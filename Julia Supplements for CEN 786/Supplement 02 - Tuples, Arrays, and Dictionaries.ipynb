    "In programming, particularly with data analysis, it is often either necessary or just ***really, really useful*** for us to work with collections of \"things\" instead of single, scalar values. You are probably familiar with this concept from your introductions to Matlab, which uses some specific types of collections called vectors and matrices. Julia includes support for vectors and matrices in addition to many other types of collections. As with scalars, each type of collection has unique properties that determine how we interact with them at the Julia console and the applications they can or should be used for. The main types of collections that we will use in this course are **tuples**, **arrays**, and **dictionaries**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple:** A tuple is set of \"items\" that are ordered and arranged by index, where the \"index\" refers to the numerical position of each element in the set. A tuple can include scalars (e.g., a tuple of strings or a tuple of integers), but it isn't limited to scalar contents.  That is, a tuple may contain other collections (e.g., a tuple of arrays or a tuple of tuples). Just like strings, tuples are **immutable**. Again, this means that we **cannot** change the contents of a tuple once it is defined. If you need to replace an element in that tuple, you have to redefine the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, you construct a tuple using parentheses.  **For example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "creates a tuple called A that contains four integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    B = (\"apples\", \"oranges\", \"bananas\") \n",
    "    \n",
    "creates a tuple called B that contains 3 different strings, and\n",

    "    C = (A, B)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Creates a tuple that includes two other tuples, A and B.  The first contains integers, and the second contains strings.  You are not constrained to a single type of scalar or even size of scalar inside of a tuple (A has 4 elements, while B has 3).\n",

If you are familiar with matrices and vectors in Matlab, you will use the **array** class in Julia to do everything you have done previously with vectors and matrices in Matlab.

    "range() is a useful basis that we can use to create large and complicates sets of numbers.  For example, let's say you want to create an array of the squares of all of the numbers between 1 and 745.  That's hard to do manually. It is even cumbersome in something like Excel.  In a programming language, we might use a **for loop** to do this.  We will cover **for loops** in more detail later, but a comprehension provides a shorthand syntax that  automates a **for loop** to generate an array from a desired operation in a single, simple line of code.  For our example above, I would create this array by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    squares = [x^2 for x in range(1, stop = 745, step = 1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "We will get into more specifics about the range function and for loops in a subsequent exercise.  Although the syntax above may look strange, all it is doing is an element-wise squaring of every number between 1 and 745, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "    1^2\n",
    "    2^2\n",
    "    3^2\n",
    "    4^2....\n",
    "    \n",
    "And so forth all the way up to\n",
    "\n",
    "    745^2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Create this Array in the cell below; print both the Array and the square root of the last element using the command below to see if it behaved as we expect\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(squares[end]^(1/2))"
   ]

    "Comprehensions are extremely useful; they can quickly generate large arrays by automating any simple operation on a range.  Create and print the arrays below to see the outputs they create and get a feel for how comprehensions work:\n",
    "\n",
    "    K = [n for n in range(0, stop = 31)] #if not specified step defaults to step = 1\n",
    "    L = [x for x in range(0, stop = 31, step = 2)]\n",

    "In the last example, notice how we used an existing array to create the iterable that the comprehension iterates over.  This is totally acceptable - it is a nice way to perform a simple operation on the values in one array to convert it into something else entirely."
