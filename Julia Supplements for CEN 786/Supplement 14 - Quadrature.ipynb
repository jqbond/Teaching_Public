    "Over the summer, I worked through some course exercises in Python that were developed by Prof. John Kitchin at Carnegie Mellon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned a lot from doing this, and I picked up some useful skills. One thing I noticed was that Prof. Kitchin makes heavy use of numerical quadrature in course, whereas I have barely used it in the past...though I can clearly see the need for it. I realized that I haven't taken full advantage of quadrature methods, but they are really nice tools to know for reactor design and analysis. The reason is that there are two situations that often arise in analysis of reactors that benefit from quadrature (numerical integration):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We frequently have to solve definite integrals for which the analytical solution is either impossible or sufficiently tedious, difficult, and error prone that it may as well be impossible. This is a good application for numerical integration using something like gaussian quadrature.\n",
    "2. We often need to integrate discrete data points; this is typically done using quadrature methods like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are built into most programming languages, and we should at least know how to use them when we need them. When you solve a definite integral on your calculator, they are most likely using some version of quadrature methods. We'll keep this exercise pretty brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to solve the following definite integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\int_0^{10} x^2 dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytically, we know that the solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{x^3}{3} \\bigg|_0^{10} = \\frac{10^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} = 333.33$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also integrate this using gaussian quadrature, which provides a numerical approximation. We will not go into detail about how gaussian quadrature works, but if you're interested, it is basically done by calculating the function value at very specific locations of the independent variable, multiplying those values by very specific weight factors, and summing up all of the results:\n",
