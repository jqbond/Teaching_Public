    "Functions are some of the most useful objects in any high level programming language, and Julia is no exception!  In very basic terms, a **function** accepts inputs (we often call these arguments as well), performs operations on them, and returns outputs.  The classic idea we all have of a function is something like y is a function of x for example,\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a simple *univariate scalar* function. We call it univariate because it has only one argument (x).  We call it scalar because it returns a single output (y). But we will see in a moment that functions are far more general and flexible. In Julia, we follow a few important rules to define a function. To start, you declare a function with the **function** keyword, and you always use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    function function_name(inputs)\n",
    "        <function body>\n",
    "    end\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \"function_name\" can be anything you want it to be, and \"inputs\" can be zero, one, or more inputs that you will provide to the function in order for it to perform its operations. Of the parts you see here, the only things that are non negotiable in a function definition are the function keyword, the function name and the end keywork; otherwise, you have a lot of flexibility in how you construct a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important to know**:  if you want a function to accept an input from you, you have to specify which inputs you will give it.  Conversely, if you want it to return an output, you will, in general, need to  tell it which outputs to return.\n",

    "In Julia, a very basic way to write our simple linear is this:\n",

    "    function y(x)\n",

    "\n",

    "Let's get used to thinking through how a piece of code will work - you really cannot learn to program until you understand how code is executed, so this is good practice. In this example, any time I want to evaluate the answer for y(x), I give a value of x to the function, i.e., I provide the necessary **input** to my function. The function then computes the \"result\" for that value of the input using whatever operations I specify, and then it **returns** values computed as outputs.  By default, a function in Julia will return the last expression computed by that function as its **output** (we'll make this more general in a moment). This is a fairly easy function to evaluate, and I can see that for x = 10, this function should give me the result that y = 25.  Let's try it in the cell below.  I would do so just by passing the argument x = 10 to my function y(x). \n",
