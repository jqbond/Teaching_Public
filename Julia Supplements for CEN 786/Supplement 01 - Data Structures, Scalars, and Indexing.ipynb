    "**Background Reading: Scalars vs. Collections**\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia supports various Data Types and Data Structures. These exercises will demonstrate usage for the most common ones in this course. It is first important to understand the difference between a **scalar** and a **collection**. In simple terms, a *scalar* refers to a something that has one and only one value associated with it, whereas a *collection* refers to a set that contains multiple items. If you are familiar with an array or a matrix in Matlab, these are examples of collections, both of which are supported in Julia. Often the contents of a collection are scalars, but this is not always the case. Julia is extremely versatile, and a \"collection\" can even be a set of other collections!  It might not be obvious now why this would be useful, but we will take advantage of this in working with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalars**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, scalars. Think of these as variables that have a single value. Although your mind probably immediately jumps to a single number as an example of a scalar (which it is), scalars in Julia are not necessarily numbers. In Julia, there are many types (classes) of scalars that we will need to be familiar with:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "* **int64** refers to an \"integer,\" which is a whole number. **Examples:** 1, 7, 452. Technically this is a 64-bit allocation.  It is usually going to be our default, but if you need to, you can specify, 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 128-bit using Int8, Int16, Int32, Int128 declarations. We probably won't need to do this at all during 786.\n",
    "* **float64** refers to a 64-bit double precision floating point decimal.  **Examples:** 2.0, 6.75, 100.3.  Again, this will be our usual default for floating point approximations, but you can select float 16 (half precision), float32 (single precision), or float64 (double precision).\n",
    "* **complex** refers to a number that has an imaginary part. **Example:** 4.2 + 6i. Note that in Julia, an \"im\" is used instead of an \"i\" for imaginary numbers.\n",
    "* **bool** A logical Boolean value. It is binary - either True or False. In most languages, including Julia, True = 1, False = 0. Julia also recognizes explicit declarations of \"true\" and \"false\"\n",
    "* **str** A \"string\" of characters.  These are typically declared in Julia using double quotes. **Examples** \"Cat\", \"Iz Doggo?\", '''Iz Sluggo?''' are strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, one defines a scalar quantity by making a declaration using an equal sign, i.e., X = 5. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "Now it is time for an **Example**. These are embedded throughout this worksheet.  We will provide a prompt that describes how to type relevant commands in Julia syntax, but to complete the worksheet, you will need to ***type*** the relevant snippets of code into the cell. Can you be lazy and copy/paste the code? Sure, but there is something about typing code that helps you get a feel for layout and how the language is written. So if you really want to master the language, *type the code*. This will give you time to really think about what you are doing and why. \n",

    "Now that we have variables defined, we can use them in all of our typical operations within the Julia language.  There are probably an infinite number of ways that you might use a variable once it is defined, but some of the most basic would be simple calculations. Math operations (at least in the way that you are familiar with them), can be performed as expected on integers, floats, or complex numbers. If you perform a math operation on a Boolean value, it will be treated as either 0 (False) or 1 (True) for the purpose of that operation.
