    "Now that we have a basic understanding of for loops, let's get a look at comprehensions.  Basically, these are shorthand for loops that are useful for performing relatively simple operations on a range of numbers or a set of values inside of an existing array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say I need a list of the squares of all of the numbers between 1 and 745.  That's hard to do manually. It is even cumbersome in something like Excel. Traditionally, we'd probably write out a for loop to do this. A  comprehension provides a shorthand syntax that  automates a **for loop** to generate an array from a desired operation in a single, simple line of code.  For our example above, in Python, I might write a loop that looks something like this using the append function for a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    squares = []\n",
    "    for number in 1:1:745\n",
    "        square = number^2\n",
    "        append!(squares, square)\n",
    "    end\n",
    "    print(size(squares))\n",
    "    squares\n",
    "\n",
    "In Matlab, I might write something like this where I append new values onto a growing array by concatenating rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    squares = []\n",
    "    for number in 1:1:745\n",
    "        square = number^2\n",

    "    end\n",
    "    print(size(squares))\n",
    "    squares\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, in Julia or Python, I can condense that quite a bit using a comprehension.  The code below is pretty much identical to what I have above, it's just much more concise and readable.\n",
